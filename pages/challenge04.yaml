title:      "Challenge 05: Selina's Medicine Bottles"

    <div class="flex-col" markdown="1">

    As usual, [Selina] is having **tummy troubles**.  Maybe she ate *dairy*
    despite having an intolerance[^1].  Or maybe she ran around the lake
    despite not having eaten[^2].  Or maybe she is stressed out because the
    instructor hasn't written that thirtieth letter of recommendation yet[^3].
    Or maybe she simply just ate at the dining hall[^4].

    Either way, her stomach is not happy and she needs to find some
    **medicine** to calm it down.

    Unfortunately, [Selina] takes a lot of medication.  Like, a lot.  Perhaps
    too many.  In fact, her backpack is a portable pharmacy[^5]... a mini [St.
    Liam's].

    Because she has so many medicine **bottles**, she decides to organize them
    according to the following rules.

    </div>

    <div class="flex-col-25" markdown="1">

    </div>
    </div>

    1.  <div class="flex-col">

        Each **bottle** has three attributes: `medication` name, bottle `size`,
        and pill `type`.

        - `size`: can be `small`, `medium`, or `large`
        - <p>`type`: can be `gel` or `tablet`</p>

    2. She wants to group all the bottles of the same `type` together with
    `gel` pills coming before `tablet` pills.

    3. Within each `type` she wants to arrange the **bottles** in **ascending**
    order **alphabetically** by `medication` name.

    4. If any of the **bottles** have the same `medication` name, then she
    wants to order them by in **ascending** order according to `size` (i.e.
    `small`, `medium`, then `large`).

    Of course, she is too busy [girlbossing] to actually do the organization
    herself.  Instead, she wants you to do the work for her so she can go
    socialize, take care of [ducks], or play with [Indy].

    ## Input

    You will be given a series of input test cases, each representing a
    collection of bottles you need to arrange according to the rules described
    above.

    Each input test case will consist of two parts.  The first line is an
    integer `n` which denotes how many bottles there are in the collection.  This
    is then followed by a series of `n` bottles in the following format:

        :::text
        MEDICATION_NAME BOTTLE_SIZE PILL_TYPE

    Here is an example input:

        ::text
        10
        Omeprazole large gel
        Metoprolol small gel
        Clopidogrel medium tablet
        Clopidogrel large tablet
        Oxycodone large gel
        Clopidogrel small tablet
        Furosemide large tablet
        Clonidine large tablet
        Simvastatin medium tablet
        Amoxicillin medium tablet

    <div class="alert warning-bg" markdown="1">
    **Note**: As described above, each **bottle** can be one of three `sizes`:
    `small`, `medium`, or `large`.  Likewise, each **bottle** can be one of
    two `types`: `gel` or `tablet`.
    </div>

    ## Output

    For each input test case, you are to order the bottles as described above
    and then display a **silhouette** of the bottles in the cabinet in the
    ordered arranged.

    For each bottle size, use the following **letter** to represent the bottle
    based on its **size** in the **silhouette**:

    <table class="bordered" markdown="1">
    <tbody markdown="1">
    <tr class="success-bg" markdown="1">
      <td markdown="1">**small**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`.`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="warning-bg" markdown="1">
      <td markdown="1">**medium**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`:`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="danger-bg" markdown="1">
      <td markdown="1">**large**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`|`</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    Here is the output for the example input above:

        ::text
        .||:|.:||:

    Arranging the input of **bottles** by the rules described above, would give the
    following sequence of **bottles**:

    <table class="bordered" markdown="1">
    <thead markdown="1">
      <th>Medication</th>
      <th>Size</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Letter</th>
    </thead>
    <tbody markdown="1">
    <tr class="success-bg" markdown="1">
    <td markdown="1">**Metoprolol**</td>
    <td markdown="1">**small**</td>
    <td markdown="1">**gel**</td>
    <td markdown="1">`.`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="warning-bg" markdown="1">
    <td markdown="1">**Omeprazole**</td>
    <td markdown="1">**large**</td>
    <td markdown="1">**gel**</td>
    <td markdown="1">`|`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="danger-bg" markdown="1">
    <td markdown="1">**Oxycodone**</td>
    <td markdown="1">**large**</td>
    <td markdown="1">**gel**</td>
    <td markdown="1">`|`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="success-bg" markdown="1">
    <td markdown="1">**Amoxicillin**</td>
    <td markdown="1">**medium**</td>
    <td markdown="1">**tablet**</td>
    <td markdown="1">`:`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="warning-bg" markdown="1">
    <td markdown="1">**Clonidine**</td>
    <td markdown="1">**large**</td>
    <td markdown="1">**tablet**</td>
    <td markdown="1">`|`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="danger-bg" markdown="1">
    <td markdown="1">**Clopidogrel**</td>
    <td markdown="1">**small**</td>
    <td markdown="1">**tablet**</td>
    <td markdown="1">`.`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="success-bg" markdown="1">
    <td markdown="1">**Clopidogrel**</td>
    <td markdown="1">**medium**</td>
    <td markdown="1">**tablet**</td>
    <td markdown="1">`:`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="warning-bg" markdown="1">
    <td markdown="1">**Clopidogrel**</td>
    <td markdown="1">**large**</td>
    <td markdown="1">**tablet**</td>
    <td markdown="1">`|`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="danger-bg" markdown="1">
    <td markdown="1">**Furosemide**</td>
    <td markdown="1">**large**</td>
    <td markdown="1">**tablet**</td>
    <td markdown="1">`|`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="success-bg" markdown="1">
    <td markdown="1">**Simvastatin**</td>
    <td markdown="1">**medium**</td>
    <td markdown="1">**tablet**</td>
    <td markdown="1">`:`</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    As can be seen, the bottles are arranged by pill `type`, then
    alphabetically `medication` name, and then by bottle `size`.

    Once arranged properly, simply combine all the `letters` corresponding to
    the bottle `sizes` into a single line to form the **silhouette** and print
    that out.

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "scale-balance" | embed_icon }}</i> Algorithmic Complexity

    For each input test case, your solution should have the following targets:

    <table class="bordered" markdown="1">
    <tbody markdown="1">
    <tr class="caution-bg" markdown="1">
      <td width="125px" markdown="1">**Time Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(Nlog(N))`, where `N` is the number of bottles for each input test case.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="warning-bg" markdown="1">
      <td markdown="1">**Space Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(N)`, where `N` is the number of bottles for each input test case.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    Your solution may be below the targets, but it **should not exceed them**.
