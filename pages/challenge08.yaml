title:      "Challenge 08: Knight's Dialer"
body:       |

    Many summers ago, **Caleb** went to a day camp where he learned how to play
    **chess**.  He quickly learned the basic rules of chess and grew to love
    playing the game (almost as much as playing **Minecraft**).  On some
    evenings, he will challenge the instructor to a game after dinner (and
    sometimes even wins!).

    </div>

    In chess each piece can move in a different manner.  For instance,
    the **rook**, Caleb's favorite piece, can move any number of spaces vertically
    or horizontally.  A **knight**, however, can only move in a `L`-shape motion:
    two steps horizontally followed by one vertically, or one step horizontally
    then two vertically:

    <div class="centered">
      <img src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*pE4b3hqGDv7pKivQTQZyPw.png">
    </div>

    Unfortunately, Caleb really dislikes the **knight** piece because its
    movement is so confusing.  To help Caleb practice visualize the movement of
    a knight, the instructor proposes the following problem to his son:

    > Imagine you place a knight chess piece on a phone dialpad.  Suppose you
    dial keys on the keypad using only hops a knight can make. Every time the
    knight lands on a key, we dial that key and make another hop. The starting
    position counts as being dialed.


    > What are the **distinct numbers** you can dial in `N` hops from a
    particular starting position?

    Because solving this problem efficiently requires the use of **recursion**,
    Caleb asks that you help him out by programming a solution that solves this
    challenge.

    ## Input

    You will be given a series of starting positions and hops in the following format:

        :::text
        START HOPS
        ...
        START HOPS

    ### Example Input

        :::text
        6 3
        0 4

    ## Output

    For each pair of starting positions and hops, output all possible numbers
    starting with the specified position and of the specified hops formed on
    the dialpad by using only the chess knight's motion.

    ### Example Output

        :::text
        604
        606
        616
        618
        672
        676

        0404
        0406
        0434
        0438
        0492
        0494
        0604
        0606
        0616
        0618
        0672
        0676

    <div class="alert warning-bg" markdown="1">
    **Note**: Output the numbers in **ascending order** and ensure there is a
    single **blank line** between the outputs of the pairs of starting
    positions and hops.

    For each input test case, your solution should have the following targets:

    <table class="bordered" markdown="1">
    <tbody markdown="1">
    <tr class="caution-bg" markdown="1">
      <td width="155px" markdown="1">**Time Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(N!)`, where `N` is the number of hops.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="danger-bg" markdown="1">
      <td markdown="1">**Space Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(D)`, where `D` is the number of distinct numbers from starting point.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    Your solution may be below the targets, but it **should not exceed them**.
