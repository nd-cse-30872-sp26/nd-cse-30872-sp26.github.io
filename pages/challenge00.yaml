    You just can't escape the [Matrix].  Even in your sleep, you still have
    nightmares of visiting the `ORACLE` and banging your head against the wall
    doing the assignments in [Systems Programming].  You are hopeful that the
    instructor is even more **respectful** of your time outside of class, but
    you have your doubts...

    Fortunately, in this problem, you are dealing with a different type of
    **matrix**:

    > Given an `n x m` 2D **matrix** consisting of numbers between `1` and `9`,
    find the **minimum four square**.  That is, find the smallest total of four
    adjacent cells in the given **matrix** as shown to the right.

    In the first example to the right, there is only one **four square**
    consisting of all `1`s, so the **minimum four square** has a total of `4`.

    </div>

    <div class="flex-col-33 centered">
      <img src="static/img/challenge00-minimum-four-square.png" class="responsive">
    </div>

    </div>

    In the second example to the right, there are two **four squares**: The
    first consists of `1, 2, 3, 4`, which sums to `10`.  The second consists
    of `2, 1, 4, 2`, which sums to `9`.  This means that the **minimum four
    square** has a total of `9`.

    In the third example to the right, there are four **four squares**.  The
    two top **four squares** consist of `1, 2, 2, 3` and sum to `8`, while the
    bottom **four squares** consist of `2, 3, 4, 1` and sum to `10`.  This
    means that the **minimum four square** has a total of `8`.

    ## Input

    You will be given a series of **matrices** in the following format:

        :::text
        N M
        D_1_1 ... D_1_M
        ...
        D_N_1 ... D_N_M

    That is, the first line has the numbers `N` and `M` (where `N` and `M` are
    between `2` and `50`), which represents the dimensions of the proceeding
    **matrix**.  This is followed by `N x M` integers that represent the data
    in the **matrix**.

    Here is an example input:

        ::text
        2 2
        1 1
        1 1
        2 3
        1 2 1
        3 4 2
        3 3
        1 2 1
        2 3 2
        4 1 4
        0 0

    This sample input corresponds to the matrixes in the diagram above.

    <div class="alert warning-bg" markdown="1">
    **Note**: The input is terminated by a final `0 0` for the `N` and `M` values.
    </div>

    ## Output

    For each **matrix** in the input stream, you are to find the **minimum four
    square** and print out its total in the following format:

    > {Matrix #}. Minimum four square is: {Total of Smallest Four Square}

    Here is the output given the example input above:

        ::text
        1. Minimum four square is: 4
        2. Minimum four square is: 9
        3. Minimum four square is: 8

    <div class="alert warning-bg" markdown="1">
    **Note**: You must match the output format **exactly**.
    </div>

    For each input test case, your solution should have the following targets:

    <table class="bordered" markdown="1">
    <tbody markdown="1">
    <tr class="warning-bg" markdown="1">
      <td width="155px" markdown="1">**Time Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(N*M)`, where `N` and `M` correspond to the dimensions of each matrix.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="caution-bg" markdown="1">
      <td markdown="1">**Space Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(1)`</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    Your solution may be below the targets, but it **should not exceed them**.

    ## Submission

    To submit your work, follow the same procedure you used for [Reading 00]:

        :::bash
        $ cd path/to/cse-30872-sp26-assignments     # Go to assignments repository
        $ git switch master                         # Make sure we are on master
        $ git pull --rebase                         # Pull any changes from GitHub

        $ git checkout -b challenge00               # Create and checkout challenge00 branch

        $ $EDITOR challenge00/program.cpp           # Edit your code

        $ git add challenge00/program.cpp           # Stage your changes
        $ git commit -m "Challenge 01: Code"        # Commit your changes

    Note, [dredd] supports [C], [C++], [Python], [Java], [Go], [Node], [Ruby],

    source file `program.$EXTENSION` where `$EXTENSION` is the appropriate file
    extension for your chosen language (e.g. `py` for [Python]).

    If you wish to try out another language, please let the instructor know and
    support can be added to [dredd].

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "check-all" | embed_icon }}</i> Test Cases

    Note, [dredd] contains additional test cases beyond that which is show in
    the examples above.  This means that even if you pass on the input above,
    you are not guaranteed to pass the [dredd] test if you do not handle
    additional situations.

    This means you should consider what the possible edge cases are and how to
    handle them.  Feel free to create your own input and output test files and
    use them to verify your program:

        :::bash
        # Manually test program
        $ ./program < input.txt | diff -u - output.txt

    To access a special debugging mode of the `check.py` script, you can use
    the following to get the output ofr [dredd].

        :::bash
        # Get debugging output from dredd
        $ DEBUG=1 ../.scripts/check.py
