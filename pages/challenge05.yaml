title:      "Challenge 05: Collatz Conjecture"
body:       |

    Problems in Computer Science are often classified as belonging to a certain
    class of problems (e.g. NP, Unsolvable, Recursive, etc.).  In this problem you
    will be analyzing a property of an algorithm whose classification is not known
    for all possible inputs:

        :::python
        1. input n
        2. print n
        3. if n = 1 then STOP
        4.      if n is odd then n = 3n + 1
        5.      else n = n / 2
        6. GOTO 2

    Given the input `22`, the following sequence of numbers would be printed:

    > `22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1`

    It is [conjectured] that the algorithm above will terminate (when a `1` is
    printed) for any integral input value.  Despite the simplicity of the
    algorithm, it is unknown whether this conjecture is true.  It has been
    verified, however, for all integers `n` such that `1 <= n <= 1,000,000`
    (and, in fact, for many more numbers than this.)

    Given an input `n`, it is possible to determine the number of numbers
    printed before and including the `1` is printed.  For a given `n` this is
    called the *cycle-length* of `n`.  In the example above, the cycle length
    of `22` is `16`.

    For any two integers `i` and `j` you are to determine the maximum cycle
    length over all numbers between and including both `i` and `j`.

    [conjectured]:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture

    ## Input

    The input will consist of a series of pairs of integers `i` and `j`, one
    pair of integers per line, where the integers will be between `1` and
    `1,000,000` (inclusive).

    You should process all pairs of integers and for each pair determine the
    maximum cycle length over all integers between and including `i` and `j`.

    ### Example Input

        :::text
        1 10
        100 200
        201 210
        900 1000

    ## Output

    For each pair of input integers `i` and `j` you should output `i`, `j`, the
    number with the maximum cycle length for integers between and including `i`
    and `j`, and the length of this maximum cycle as shown below:

    ### Example Output

        :::text
        1 10 9 20
        100 200 171 125
        201 210 206 89
        900 1000 937 174

    **Note**: The integers `i` and `j` must appear in the output in the same
    order in which they appeared in the input and should be followed by the
    number with the maximum cycle length, and then maximum cycle length (on the
    same line).  If there are multiple numbers with the maximum cycle length,
    choose the smallest number.

    For each input test case, your solution should have the following targets:

    <table class="bordered" markdown="1">
    <tbody markdown="1">
    <tr class="caution-bg" markdown="1">
      <td width="155px" markdown="1">**Time Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(N^3)`, where `N` is the largest of the pair of input integers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="warning-bg" markdown="1">
      <td markdown="1">**Space Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(N^2)` where `N` is the largest of the pair of input integers.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    Your solution may be below the targets, but it **should not exceed them**.

    ## Submission

    To submit your work, follow the same procedure you used for [Reading 00]:

        :::bash
        $ cd path/to/cse-30872-sp26-assignments     # Go to assignments repository
        $ git switch master                         # Make sure we are on master
        $ git pull --rebase                         # Pull any changes from GitHub

        $ git switch -c challenge05                 # Create and checkout challenge05 branch

        $ $EDITOR challenge05/program.cpp           # Edit your code

        $ git add challenge05/program.cpp           # Stage your changes
        $ git commit -m "Challenge 05: Code"        # Commit your changes

        $ git push -u origin challenge05            # Send changes to GitHub

    To check your code, you can use the `.scripts/check.py` script or [curl]:
