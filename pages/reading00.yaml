title:      "Reading 00: Orientation, I/O"
body:       |

    **Everyone**:

    Welcome to [CSE 30872 Programming Challenges], which (as the syllabus
    states) is a "course that revolves around solving *brain-teaser* and
    *puzzle-type* problems that often appear in programming contests, online
    challenges, and job interviews".  What this means is that we will be
    studying common data structures, algorithms, and programming techniques
    that are useful in tackling a variety of problems.

    <div class="alert info-bg" markdown="1">

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "book" | embed_icon }}</i> TL;DR

    For this week, you should familiarize yourself with using [Slack], setup
    your [GitHub] assignments repository, read about I/O and complexity, and
    then submit your responses to the [Reading 00 Quiz].

    </div>

    ## Course Overview

    Before this course, most of you have taken **Data Structures** where you
    learned about the properties and characteristics of different data
    structures (and perhaps you even implemented a few).  The focus of this
    class, however, is not in the *construction* of these data structures, but
    rather their *application*.  This means we will focus on *when* to use
    these data structures and algorithms and *how* to utilize them effectively
    rather than *what* they are.  In concrete terms, we will not be
    implementing say a [hash table]; instead we will use one to solve a variety
    of problems.

    Following the [Hands-On Imperative], you will have the opportunity to put
    the material we discuss in class into practice via a *respectful* number of
    weekly **programming Challenges** (**two a week**).  Along with these
    challenges will be **Reading assignments** to ensure you have a context or
    background knowledge for what we will be discussing in class.  As with
    [Systems Programming] or [Operating System Principles], these assignments
    will be automatically graded by [dredd] via the [continuous integration]
    system provided by [GitHub].

    Although each class will involve some amount of lecture, there will also be
    a lot of in-class activities and hands-on learning.  Because of this, you
    are expected to come to class **regularly** and **on-time**.

    Fortunately, however, there are **no exams** in this class.  Instead, we
    will have **four individual in-class programming contests** and **two
    programming interviews** where you will have an opportunity to demonstrate
    your mastery and understanding of the material explored in class.
    Likewise, you will also have to participate in **two external programming
    contests** such as those provided by [HackerRank] or [LeetCode].

    ## Task 1: Slack

    For communication outside of our classroom, we will be using [Slack],
    which is a real-time chat platform similar to **Discord**.  Your first task is
    to create a **ND-CSE** [Slack] account (if you have not done so already)
    and join the `#cse-30872-sp26` channel:

    > [https://nd-cse.slack.com/messages/cse-30872-sp26/](https://nd-cse.slack.com/messages/cse-30872-sp26/)

    <div class="alert info-bg" markdown="1">

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "slack" | embed_icon }}</i> Slack Channel

    There is a [class mailing list], but most day-to-day communication
    (including office hours and homework help) should take place on [Slack].

    Therefore, you should **check this channel regularly** as it is the primary
    means of communication for the course.

    </div>

    ## Task 2: GitHub

    All of your work in this class will be submitted to [GitHub] using [git].
    Your second task is to setup your [GitHub] **assignments** repository by doing
    the following:

    1.  <div class="flex-col">

        **Sign-in** or create a [GitHub] account if you do not already have one.

        > [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join)

        You may associate this account with either your Notre Dame or personal
        email address.  It is up to you.

    2.  <div class="flex-col">

        **Fork** the class assignments repository from the following template:

        > [https://classroom.github.com/a/nJUwrO_H](https://classroom.github.com/a/nJUwrO_H)

        This will create a **private** `assignments-$GITHUB_USERNAME`
        repository under your own account and linked to the [nd-cse-30872-sp26]
        organization.

    <div class="alert danger-bg" markdown="1">

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "github" | embed_icon }}</i> GitHub Repository

    The **assignments** repository will be used for your individual **reading**
    and **challenge** assignments. It must be kept **private** and only shared
    with the **instructional staff**.

    </div>

    [git]: https://git-scm.com/

    ### Task 3: Student Machines

    While you are free to use any machine you wish to do your work, the
    department provides a set of **student machines** that you can login to and
    do remote work in an environment crafted for the course.  The following
    steps allow you to **clone** the **assigments** you just created to any
    machine of your choosing.

    <div class="alert info-bg" markdown="1">

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "server" | embed_icon }}</i> Student Machines

    As a reminder, students in this class have access to the following
    **student** machines: `student05.cse.nd.edu`, `student10.cse.nd.edu`,
    `student11.cse.nd.edu`, `student12.cse.nd.edu`, `student13.cse.nd.edu`.

    </div>

    1.  <div class="flex-col">

        Before you can **clone** your [git] repository, you will need to
        determine which form of **authentication**, you wish to use with
        [GitHub].

        To remotely access your repository from the command-line, you have two options:

        1.  <div class="flex-col">

            [Setup SSH Keys]: With this method, you generate a local public and
            private key pair on your computer and then upload the **public
            key** to [GitHub].  When accessing [GitHub] from the
            command-line, you will use the **private key** to authenticate to
            the server.

            This is the **recommended** way to setup your repository as it will
            allow for **passwordless** access.

        2. [Setup a Personal Access Token]: With this method, [GitHub] will
          generate an application specific passsword that you can use with
          **HTTPS**.  As the **PAT** is a long string of characters, it is
          recommended that you use it in conjunction with a **password
          manager** or **keyring**.

        <div class="alert success-bg" markdown="1">

        ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "key-chain" | embed_icon }}</i> Setup SSH Keys

        <div class="alert warning-bg" markdown="1">

        **Note**: If you have already [Setup SSH Keys] in another course (such
        as **Systems Programming**), you **do not** need to make new keys and
        can skip this process.

        </div>

        Here is a quick tutorial on how to [Setup SSH Keys] on the **student
        machines** (*if you have not done so already*):

        1.  <div class="flex-col">

            Generate SSH keys if you don't have them yet:

                :::bash
                # Accept the defaults, don't make a password if you want to go passwordless
                $ ssh-keygen

        2.  <div class="flex-col">

            Copy the contents of `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to the **SSH Keys** section of
            your [GitHub] settings page:

            > [https://github.com/settings/keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)

                :::bash
                # Copy and paste the contents of this file into GitHub
                $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

        3.  <div class="flex-col">

            Edit/create `~/.ssh/config` to use this key with [GitHub]:

                :::bash
                # Add the following to your config (replace $NETID with your netid)
                $ vim ~/.ssh/config
                Host github.com
                        User git
                        Hostname github.com
                        PreferredAuthentications publickey
                        IdentityFile /escnfs/home/$NETID/.ssh/id_rsa

        Once this is done, you should be able to do [git] operations without a password.
        You will need to accept the host key the first time by typing in `"yes"`.
        </div>

    2.  <div class="flex-col">

        **Clone** your [git] repository on one of the **student machines**:

            :::bash
            # Example of cloning GitHub assignments repository to local or student machine
            $ git clone git@github.com:nd-cse-30872-sp26/assignments-$GITHUB_USERNAME.git
            remote: Enumerating objects: 70, done.
            remote: Counting objects: 100% (70/70), done.
            remote: Compressing objects: 100% (13/13), done.
            Receiving objects: 100% (70/70), 6.25 KiB | 1.56 MiB/s, done.
            Resolving deltas: 100% (4/4), done.
            remote: Total 70 (delta 4), reused 70 (delta 4), pack-reused 0

    3.  <div class="flex-col">

        **Edit** the `README.md` file in your **assignments** repository such
        that the **Name** and **NetID** fields are completed (i.e. replace
        "Domer McDomerson" and "dmcdomer"). You should **commit** your change
        and then **push** them to [GitHub].

            :::bash
            # Example on editing README in assignments repository and pushing changes to GitHub

            $ cd assignments-$GITHUB_USERNAME           # Go into the assignments directory

            $ nano README.md                            # Edit the README.md file

            $ git add README.md                         # Mark the file for recording

            $ git commit -m "Update README"             # Record the change
            [master c550fa1] Update README
            1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)

    ## Task 4: Readings

    The readings for **Monday, January 12** are

    1. [CSE 30872 Programming Challenges (Spring 2026)](index.html)

    2.  <div class="flex-col">

        [Competitive Programmer's Handbook]

        - Chapter 1 Introduction

        - Chapter 2 Time Complexity

    <div class="alert success-bg" markdown="1">
    **Note**: Don't worry if you don't get the readings done by Monday, as
    this is the first week of class.
    </div>

    ## Task 5: Quiz

    Once you have done the readings, answer the following [Reading 00 Quiz]
    questions:

    <div id="quiz-questions"></div>

    <div id="quiz-responses"></div>

    <script src="static/js/dredd-quiz.js"></script>
    <script>
    loadQuiz('static/json/reading00.json');
    </script>

    <pre style="display: none;" id="dr-container" class="codehilite"><code id="dredd-response"></code></pre>

    To submit your answers, you will need create a `answers.json` or
    `answers.yaml` file in the `reading00` folder of your **assignments**
    repository:

    1.  <div class="flex-col">

        For this class, you must use a **separate [git] branch for each
        assignment**.  This means that the work for each reading and challenge
        must be done in a separate branch.  To create and switch to a new
        branch, you can do the following:

            :::bash
            $ git switch master           # Make sure we are in master branch
            $ git pull --rebase           # Make sure we are up-to-date with github repository

            $ git switch -c reading00     # Create reading00 branch and check it out

        Once you do the above, you should see the following output for the
        [git-branch] command:

            :::bash
            $ git branch
              master
            * reading00

        The `*` indicates that we are currently on the `reading00` branch.

    2.  <div class="flex-col">

        You can either hand-write the `answers` file using your favorite text
        editor or you can use the online form to generate the [JSON] data.

        A hand-written `answers.yaml` may look like the following:

            :::text
            q1:     [python,perl,ruby]
            q2:     [n2,nf,nlogn,1,n,sqrtn,logn]
            q3:     n
            q4:     n

        The equivalent `answers.json` generated using the online form may look
        like the following:

            :::json
            {
              "q1": [
                "python",
                "perl",
                "ruby"
              ],
              "q2": [
                "n2",
                "nf",
                "nlogn",
                "1",
                "n",
                "sqrtn",
                "logn"
              ],
              "q3": "n",
              "q4": "n"
            }

        You may use either format.  To determine which symbols correspond to
        which response, take a look at the [Reading 00 Quiz] file.

        To check your answers, you can use the provided `.scripts/check.py`
        script:

            :::bash
            $ cd reading00                        # Go into reading00 folder
            $ $EDITOR answers.json                # Edit your answers.json file

            $ ../.scripts/check.py                # Submit reading00
            Checking reading00 quiz ...
                  Q1  4.00 /  4.00
                  Q2  7.00 /  7.00
                  Q3  1.00 /  1.00
                  Q4  1.00 /  1.00
                  Q5  8.00 /  8.00
              --------------------
               Score 21.00 / 21.00
               Grade  1.00 /  1.00
              Status Success

        This script will check your responses by sending your
        `reading00/answers.json` file to [dredd], which is the automated grading
        system. [dredd] will take your answers and return to you a score and
        overall status as shown above.

        <div class="alert success-bg" markdown="1">

        **Note**: `Score` is how many points you received out of the maximum
        number of attempted points, while `Grade` is the amount of normalized
        points that will be recorded on **Canvas**.

        Moreover, `Status` is `Success` if you have achieved full credit
        (otherwise, it will show `Failure`).

        </div>

    3.  <div class="flex-col">

        Once you have your answers file, you need to add, commit the file, and
        push your commits to [GitHub]:

            :::bash
            $ git add answers.json                # Add answers.json to staging area
            $ git commit -m "Reading 00: Quiz"    # Commit work

            $ git push -u origin reading00        # Push branch to GitHub


        <div class="alert success-bg" markdown="1">

        ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "git" | embed_icon }}</i> Iterative Approach

        You may edit and commit changes to your branch as many times as you wish.
        Just make sure all of your work goes in the appropriate branch and then
        perform a `git push` when you are done.
        </div>

    4.  <div class="flex-col">

        When you are ready for your final submission, you need to create a
        **pull request** via the [GitHub] interface:

        -   <div class="flex-col">

            First, go to your repository's **Branches** page and then press the
            **New pull request** button for the appropriate branch:

            <div class="centered">
              <img src="static/img/reading00-github-branches.png" class="responsive"/>
            </div>

        -   <div class="flex-col">

            Next, edit the **Pull Request** title to "Reading 00", write a
            comment if necessary, assign the appropriate **TA** from the
            [Reading 00 TA List], and then press the "Create pull request"
            button.

            <div class="centered">
              <img src="static/img/reading00-github-pull-request.png" class="responsive"/>
            </div>

            <div class="alert danger-bg" markdown="1">

            ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "close-octogon" | embed_icon }}</i> Don't Merge!

            **DO NOT MERGE your own Pull Requests**.  The TAs use open **Pull Requests**
            to keep track of which assignments to grade.  Closing them yourself will
            confuse the TAs and cause a delay in grading.

            </div>

        -   <div class="flex-col">

            Every commit on [GitHub] will automatically check your quiz or code
            with [dredd] and the results of each run is displayed in the **Checks**
            tab of each commit as shown below:

            <div class="centered">
              <img src="static/img/reading00-github-checks.png" class="responsive"/>
            </div>

      Once you have made the **Pull Request**, the TA can verify your work and
      provide feedback via the discussion form inside the **Pull Request**. If
      necessary, you can update your submission by simply commit and pushing to
      the appropriate branch; the **Pull Request** will automatically be
      updated to match your latest work.

    <div class="alert warning-bg" markdown="1">

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "lifebuoy" | embed_icon }}</i> Acknowledgments

    If you collaborated with any other students, or received help from TAs or AI
    tools on this assignment, please record this support in the `README.md` in
    the `reading00` folder and include it with your **Pull Request**.

    </div>

    <div class="alert success-bg" markdown="1">

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "account-question" | embed_icon }}</i> Graders

    Once you have committed your work and pushed it to [GitHub], remember to
    create a **pull request** and assign it to the appropriate **teaching
    assistant** from the [Reading 00 TA List].

    **Note**: this list changes each week, so be sure to consult the appropriate
    list for each assignment.
