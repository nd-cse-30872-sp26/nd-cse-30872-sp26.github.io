    Abigail and Madeline, the instructor's daughters, are identical twins who
    love dancing, singing, drawing, knitting, and performing at [South Bend
    Civic Theatre][^1].  The girls are always making up stories, composing
    music, crafting things, or playing with their Pokemon.  When it comes to
    math, however, the twins are not quite so fond of playing around with
    numbers [^2]...

    For the past few days, Abigail and Madeline have been working on the
    <b>triplet</b> problem:

    > Given a list of **numbers** with `n` integers, determine if there are
    elements `a`, `b`, `c`, in **numbers** such that `a + b + c = 0`.  Find all
    unique **triplets** in the list of **numbers**.

    For example, given the following numbers:

        :::text
        -1 0 1 2 -1 -4

    Abi and Maddy see that you can make the following **triplets**:

        :::text
        -1 + -1 + 2
        -1 + 0 + 1

    </div>

    <div class="flex-col-33" markdown="1">

    </div>

    </div>

    For small sequences of numbers, the twins are comfortable using trial and
    error (ie. guess and check) to find **triplets**.  Unfortunately, their
    father is mean and is giving them problems with larger sequences of
    numbers.

    They would like your help in automating the process of searching for
    **triplets** using the magic of **programming**!

    ## Input

    You will be given a series of numbers, one sequence per line as shown
    below:

    ### Example Input

        :::text
        -1 0 1 2 -1 -4

    ## Output

    For each sequence of numbers, print out all the **triplets** in **ascending
    order**:

    ### Example Output

        :::text
        -1 + -1 + 2
        -1 + 0 + 1

    <div class="alert warning-bg" markdown="1">

    **Note**: Output the numbers in **ascending order** and ensure there is a
      single **blank line** between the outputs of each input sequence of
      numbers.

    For each input test case, your solution should have the following targets:

    <table class="bordered" markdown="1">
    <tbody markdown="1">
    <tr class="caution-bg" markdown="1">
      <td width="155px" markdown="1">**Time Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(2^N)`, where `N` is the length of each input sequence.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="danger-bg" markdown="1">
      <td markdown="1">**Space Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(2^N)`, where `N` is the length of each input sequence.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    Your solution may be below the targets, but it **should not exceed them**.

    [^2]: Actually, not true.  They do like math and are quite good at it.
      Probably get it from their mother.

    ## Submission

    To submit your work, follow the same procedure you used for [Reading 00]:

        :::bash
        $ cd path/to/cse-30872-sp26-assignments     # Go to assignments repository
        $ git switch master                         # Make sure we are on master
        $ git pull --rebase                         # Pull any changes from GitHub

        $ git switch -b challenge07                 # Create and checkout challenge07 branch

        $ $EDITOR challenge07/program.cpp           # Edit your code

        $ git add challenge07/program.cpp           # Stage your changes
        $ git commit -m "Challenge 07: Code"        # Commit your changes

        $ git push -u origin challenge07            # Send changes to GitHub

    To check your code, you can use the `.scripts/check.py` script or [curl]:

        :::bash
        $ .scripts/check.py
        Checking challenge07 program.cpp ...
          Result Success
            Time  0.03
          --------------------
           Score  6.00 /  6.00
           Grade  1.00 /  1.00

        $ curl -F source=@challenge07/program.cpp https://dredd.h4x0r.space/code/cse-30872-sp26/challenge07
        {"result": "Success", "score": 6, "time": 0.11464905738830566, "value": 6, "status": 0}
