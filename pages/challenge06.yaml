title:      "Challenge 06: Distinct Fruit"
body:       |

    <div class="flex-row" markdown="1">

    Once again, the instructor is engaging[^1] in some [biohacking].  This
    means that he tries to avoid eating things like red meat and dairy when
    possible, and instead eats ate a lot of fruits and vegetables.

    Because eating apples everyday is pretty boring, the instructor created a
    script that generates a sequence of fruits to eat (one per day).  For example:

        ::text
        banana tangerine banana peach peach banana

    This means that on the first day, he will eat a `banana` and on the second
    day he will eat a `tangerine` and so on and so forth.

    Since this script uses a random number generator to select the sequence of
    fruits, there are sometimes duplicates in his fruit eating schedule.  This
    can be unfortunate, because the instructor doesn't want to eat the same
    thing everyday [^2].

    Given a sequence of fruits, the instructor wants to know what it is the
    length of longest subsequence of days with distinct fruits (and what fruits
    are in that subsequence).

    For instance, in the example above, the longest sequence of days with
    distinct fruits is `tangerine banana peach` and so the length is `3`.

    ## Input

    You will be given a series of fruit sequences, one sequence per line.  Each
    line will contain a sequence of fruits separate by spaces as show below:

    ### Example Input

        :::text
        pineapple
        orange grape
        grape coconut pear
        peach pineapple peach peach
        grape apple banana peach pineapple
        banana tangerine banana peach peach banana
        apple grape tangerine coconut apple coconut grape
        apple grape banana tangerine pineapple pear orange banana
        pineapple apple coconut apple pineapple banana pineapple orange coconut

    ## Output

    For each sequence of fruits, you are to report the longest sequence of
    distinct fruits as show below:

    ### Example Output

        :::text
        1: pineapple
        2: orange, grape
        3: grape, coconut, pear
        2: peach, pineapple
        5: grape, apple, banana, peach, pineapple
        3: tangerine, banana, peach
        4: apple, grape, tangerine, coconut
        7: apple, grape, banana, tangerine, pineapple, pear, orange
        4: coconut, apple, pineapple, banana

    **Note**, you should display the **length** of the subsequence, followed by
    the **fruits**, separated by `", "`.  If there are multiple subsequences
    with the maximum length, choose the first subsequence. **Make sure there is
    no trailing space**.

    For each input test case, your solution should have the following targets:

    <table class="bordered" markdown="1">
    <tbody markdown="1">
    <tr class="caution-bg" markdown="1">
      <td width="155px" markdown="1">**Time Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(N)`, where `N` is the length of each input sequence.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="warning-bg" markdown="1">
      <td markdown="1">**Space Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(N)`, where `N` is the length of each input sequence.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    Your solution may be below the targets, but it **should not exceed them**.

    [^1]:   It's just a diet... kinda.
    [^2]:   Actually not true.  I do eat basically the same thing everyday...

        $ git switch master                         # Make sure we are on master
        $ git pull --rebase                         # Pull any changes from GitHub

        $ git switch -c challenge06                 # Create and checkout challenge06 branch

        $ $EDITOR challenge06/program.cpp           # Edit your code

        $ git add challenge06/program.cpp           # Stage your changes
        $ git commit -m "Challenge 06: Code"        # Commit your changes

        $ git push -u origin challenge06            # Send changes to GitHub

    To check your code, you can use the `.scripts/check.py` script or [curl]:
