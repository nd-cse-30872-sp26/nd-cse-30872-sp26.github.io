    Not content with a job at a **hot** Silicon Valley startup, **Sam** is
    still grinding **hard** on [LeetCode] challenges[^1] in hopes of leveling
    up to another software engineering gig.

    In fact, he was *geeking* out on their **30-day Challenge** during the
    month of May and came across this problem:

    > Suppose an array of unique numbers sorted in ascending order is **rotated**
    > at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
    > <br><br>
    > For instance, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.
    > <br><br>
    > You are given a `target` value to search. If found in the array report its
    > `index`, otherwise report it is not found.

    Because *Sam* is busy networking with people on [LinkedIn], he asks that
    you repay him for the help he provided you in [Systems Programming] by
    coding up a solution to this problem for him.

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "trophy" | embed_icon }}</i> LeetCode

    This programming challenge is based on [33. Search in Rotated Sorted
    Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/) from
    [LeetCode].

    </div>

    ## Input

    Each input test case will consist of two lines.  The first line contains
    the sorted but rotated `array`, while the second line contains the `target`
    to search for within the `array`.

    Here is an example input:

        ::text
        4 5 6 7 0 1 2
        0
        4 5 6 7 0 1 2
        3
        3 5 1
        3

    ## Output

    For each input test case, you are to output a message in the following
    format if the `target` is found:

        :::text
        {target} found at index {index}

    If the `target` is not in the `array`, then report:

        :::text
        {target} was not found

    Here is the output for the example input above:

        ::text
        0 found at index 4
        3 was not found
        3 found at index 0

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "scale-balance" | embed_icon }}</i> Algorithmic Complexity

    For each input test case, your solution should have the following targets:

    <table class="bordered" style="background-color: white" markdown="1">
    <tbody markdown="1">
    <tr class="caution-bg" markdown="1">
      <td width="125px" markdown="1">**Time Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(log(N))`, where `N` is the length of each input array.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="warning-bg" markdown="1">
      <td markdown="1">**Space Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(log(N))`, where `N` is the length of each input array.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    Your solution may be below the targets, but it **should not exceed them**.

    </div>

    ## Submission

    To submit your work, follow the same procedure you used for [Reading 00]:

        :::bash
        $ cd path/to/cse-30872-sp26-assignments     # Go to assignments repository
        $ git switch master                         # Make sure we are on master
        $ git pull --rebase                         # Pull any changes from GitHub

        $ git switch -c challenge03                 # Create and checkout challenge03 branch

        $ $EDITOR challenge03/program.cpp           # Edit your code

        $ git add challenge03/program.cpp           # Stage your changes
        $ git commit -m "Challenge 03: Code"        # Commit your changes

        $ git push -u origin challenge03            # Send changes to GitHub

    To check your code, you can use the `.scripts/check.py` script or [curl]:

        :::bash
        $ .scripts/check.py
        Checking challenge03 program.cpp ...
          Result Success
            Time  0.16
          --------------------
           Score  6.00 /  6.00
           Grade  1.00 /  1.00

        $ curl -F source=@challenge03/program.cpp https://dredd.h4x0r.space/code/cse-30872-sp26/challenge03
        {"result": "Success", "score": 6, "time": 0.16451787948608398, "value": 6, "status": 0}
