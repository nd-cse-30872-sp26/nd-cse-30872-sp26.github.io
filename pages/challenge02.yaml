title:      "Challenge 02: HTML Tags"
body:       |

    <div class="flex-row" markdown="1">

    <div class="flex-col" markdown="1">

    You really enjoyed parsing and manipulating [HTML] using [regular
    expressions] and [Python] in [Systems Programming].  It was interesting to
    see a [declarative language] that just required you to format data using
    some [HTML] tags to describe what the text meant and not worry about
    control flow or anything complex like that.

    In fact, because of how easy it is to use your favorite `$EDITOR` to create
    some [HTML] documents, you decide to make your own personal website using
    [GitHub Pages].  This is a free service that let's you make a public
    webpage using static [HTML], which provides a convenient place to highlight
    your projects and interests!
    
    After writing some custom [HTML] though, you realize that there is one
    problem when it comes to writing [HTML] by hand... it is sometimes
    difficult to keep track of all of the [HTML] tags and make sure that they
    are **balanced**.

    </div>

    <div class="flex-col-25 centered">
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg/240px-HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png">
    </div>

    </div>

    For instance, the following is considered **balanced**:

        :::html
        The <i>quick</i> brown fox jumps over the <b>lazy</b> dog

    That is, the *opening* of each tag (ie. `<i>` or `<b>`) is followed by the
    closing of each tag (ie. `</i>` or `</b>`).

    The following, however, is not **balanced**:

        :::html
        The <i><u>quick</i></u> brown fox jumps over the <b>lazy</b> dog

    In this example, the `<u>` tag is followed by the `</i>` closing tag before
    it encounters its corresponding `</u>` closing tag, and is thus considered
    **unbalanced**.

    Your job is to write a simple [HTML] **linter** that checks if tags are
    properly **balanced**.

    ## Input

    The input consists of a series of lines that may or may not contain
    multiple [HTML] tags.

    Here is an example input:

        ::text
        A <tt>tag</tt>
        A <tt>tag
        A <b><tt>tag</tt></b>
        A <b><tt>tag</b></tt>

    <div class="alert warning-bg" markdown="1">

    **Note**: You are only concerned with the tags and not with any of the
    text.  Likewise, there are **no attributes** in these tags (eg. you may
    assume the tags are in the form `<TAG>` and `</TAG>`.

    </div>

    ## Output

    For each line of [HTML], you are to determine if the tags on that line is
    balanced or not and report the result.

    Here is the output for the example input above:

        ::text
        Balanced
        Unbalanced
        Balanced
        Unbalanced

    <div class="alert danger-bg" markdown="1">

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "scale-balance" | embed_icon }}</i> Algorithmic Complexity

    For each input test case, your solution should have the following targets:

    <table class="bordered" markdown="1">
    <tbody markdown="1">
    <tr class="warning-bg" markdown="1">
      <td width="125px" markdown="1">**Time Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(N)`, where `N` corresponds to the length of the input string.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="caution-bg" markdown="1">
      <td markdown="1">**Space Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(N)`, where `N` corresponds to the length of the input string.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    Your solution may be below the targets, but it **should not exceed them**.

    </div>

    ## Submission

    To submit your work, follow the same procedure you used for [Reading 01]:

        :::bash
        $ cd path/to/cse-30872-sp26-assignments     # Go to assignments repository
        $ git switch master                         # Make sure we are on master
        $ git pull --rebase                         # Pull any changes from GitHub

        $ git switch -c challenge02                 # Create and checkout challenge02 branch

        $ $EDITOR challenge02/program.cpp           # Edit your code

        $ git add challenge02/program.cpp           # Stage your changes
        $ git commit -m "Challenge 02: Code"        # Commit your changes

        $ git push -u origin challenge02            # Send changes to GitHub

    To check your code, you can use the `.scripts/check.py` script or [curl]:

        :::bash
        $ .scripts/check.py
        Checking challenge02 program.cpp ...
          Result Success
            Time  0.00
          --------------------
           Score  6.00 /  6.00
           Grade  1.00 /  1.00

        $ curl -F source=@challenge02/program.cpp https://dredd.h4x0r.space/code/cse-30872-sp26/challenge02
        {"result": "Success", "score": 6, "time": 0.016292572021484375, "value": 6, "status": 0}
