title:      "Challenge 01: Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"
body:       |

    After enjoying watching [The Greatest Showman] outside at the [Movies on
    the Lawn] in the [Orange County Great Park] many years ago, the
    instructor's children asked to watch more musicals.  Having grown up a huge
    Disney fan, the instructor's wife showed them the classic [Mary Poppins].

    </div>

    In this musical, there is a song about the peculiar and ridiculous[^1] word
    [Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious].  The children thought this word was
    **hilarious** and asked [Alexa] to play the song over and over[^2].
    Eventually, they asked [Alexa] to spell the word, but the
    <strike>spy</strike> <strike>nanny</strike> digital assistant didn't
    understand their command, so the children (begrudgingly) resorted to asking
    their parents, who wrote down the word for them on some paper[^3].

    Looking at the word on paper, the children realized they could form many
    smaller words from the letters in [Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious].
    For instance, they could form the word `is` three times, `ace` twice, and
    `rage` once using the letters in [Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious] only
    up to the number times they occurred in the original word.

    Knowing that their father has a bunch of students who do that computer
    programming thing, they asked him to request that you write a program that
    determines the number of times a word could be formed out of the letters of
    another word.

    ## Input

    The input will be a series of space-separated word pairs, `s1` and `s2`,
    with one pair per line.  Here is an example input:

        ::text
        supercalifragilisticexpialidocious is
        supercalifragilisticexpialidocious ace
        supercalifragilisticexpialidocious rage

    ## Output

    For each pair of words, your program is to determine how many times `s2`
    can be formed using the letters in `s1` (where each letter in `s1` is only
    used up to the number of times it appears in `s1`) and print out that
    number.

    Here is the output for the example input above:

        ::text
        3
        2
        1

    For each input test case, your solution should have the following targets:

    <table class="bordered" markdown="1">
    <tbody markdown="1">
    <tr class="warning-bg" markdown="1">
      <td width="125px" markdown="1">**Time Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(S1 + S2)`, where `S1` and `S2` correspond to the lengths of each word in the input pair.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="caution-bg" markdown="1">
      <td markdown="1">**Space Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(1)`</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    Your solution may be below the targets, but it **should not exceed them**.

    ## Submission

    To submit your work, follow the same procedure you used for [Reading 00]:

        :::bash
        $ cd path/to/cse-30872-sp26-assignments     # Go to assignments repository
        $ git switch master                         # Make sure we are on master
        $ git pull --rebase                         # Pull any changes from GitHub

        $ git switch -c challenge01                 # Create and checkout challenge02 branch

        $ $EDITOR challenge01/program.cpp           # Edit your code

        $ git add challenge01/program.cpp           # Stage your changes
        $ git commit -m "Challenge 01: Code"        # Commit your changes

        $ git push -u origin challenge01            # Send changes to GitHub

    To check your code, you can use the `.scripts/check.py` script or [curl]:

        :::bash
        $ .scripts/check.py
        Checking challenge01 program.cpp ...
          Result Success
