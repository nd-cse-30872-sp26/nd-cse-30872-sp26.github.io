title:      "Challenge 10: Seb's Horchata Hustle"

    Despite securing employment at the international [fruit farm], [Seb] is not
    quite done hustling yet.  In between [sigma grinding] this summer,
    surveilling peers and colleagues on social media, and experimenting with
    advanced **emoji** generation algorithms, [Seb] has decided to setup a
    booth selling fresh [horchata][^1]!

    An enterprising fellow, [Seb] decides to sell each delicious cup of rice
    milk with cinnamon at reasonable price of `$5`[^2].  Moreover to keep things
    simple, he only will accept bills in the following denominations: `$5`, `$10`,
    and `$20`.

    Unfortunately, his small business is a bit underresourced, so he doesn't
    have any capital left after making his batch of [horchata].  This means
    that if any customer requires change (ie. pays `$10` or `$20` instead of
    `$5`), he must make change out of the money he has already collected from
    previous customers...  which is quite the challenge in this economy and
    highly dependent on the sequence of customers.

    For instance, given the following sequence of customers, represented by the
    bills they are using to pay for their [horchata]:

        :::text
        5 5 5 10 20

    The first three customers don't need any change because they paid the exact
    amount for a cup of [horchata].  The fourth customer requires `$5` which is
    fine since you have `3` of those bills.  The fifth customer requires `$15`
    which is also fine since you can give them the `$10` and one of your
    remaining `$5`.  So in this sequence, [Seb] can successfully provide each
    customer the exact amount of change they each required.

    However, given the following sequence of customers

        :::
        5 5 10 10 20

    The first two customers don't need any change because they paid the exact
    amount of a cup of [horchata].  The third customer requires `$5` which is
    fine since you have two of those bills.  Likewise, the fourth customer also
    requires `$5` in change which is okay since you have one left.
    Unfortunately, the last customer, requires `$15` in change, but you can't
    do this since you only have two `$10` bills left and thus **cannot make
    exact change** for each customer.

    Because of this volatility and to determine if this business model is even
    feasible, [Seb] wants to write a simulator that takes in a sequence of
    customers (represented by the **dollar bills** they are spending) and
    **determines whether or not he can give each customer the correct amount of
    change** despite starting the business with `0` money.

    Unfortunately, he is busy doing hero office hours late at night in the
    library again and needs you to write the simulator for him.

      at graduation!

    ## Input

    You will be given a series of input test cases.  Each input test case is a
    sequence of customers and the bills (ie. `5`, `10`, or `20`) they are using
    to pay for their [horchata].

    ### Example Input

        :::text
        5 5 5 10 20
        5 5 10 10 20

    ## Output

    For each input test case, output `Yeah` if Seb can provide every customer
    in the sequence the correct amount of change.  Otherwise, output `Nope`.

    Prefix each output with the test case number, starting with `1`.

    ### Example Output


    Here is the output for the example input above:

        :::text
        1. Yeah
        2. Nope

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "scale-balance" | embed_icon }}</i> Algorithmic Complexity

    For each input test case, your solution should have the following targets:

    <table class="bordered" markdown="1">
    <tbody markdown="1">
    <tr class="caution-bg" markdown="1">
      <td width="155px" markdown="1">**Time Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(N)`, where `N` is the number of customers in each input case.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="danger-bg" markdown="1">
      <td markdown="1">**Space Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(N)`, where `N` is the number of customers in each input case.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    Your solution may be below the targets, but it **should not exceed them**.

    ## Submission

    To submit your work, follow the same procedure you used for [Reading 00]:

        :::bash
        $ cd path/to/cse-30872-sp26-assignments     # Go to assignments repository
        $ git switch master                         # Make sure we are on master
        $ git pull --rebase                         # Pull any changes from GitHub

        $ git switch -c challenge10                 # Create and checkout challenge10 branch

        $ $EDITOR challenge10/program.cpp           # Edit your code

        $ git add challenge10/program.cpp           # Stage your changes
