title:      "Reading 05: Bit Manipulation, Greedy Algorithms"
body:       |

    **Everyone**:

    Next week, we will work on problems related to [greedy algorithms], which
    is a problem solving approach where we attempt to find a global optimum by
    always making the locally optimal choice, and [bit manipulation].  These
    techniques will come in handy for solving [Challenge 09] and [Challenge
    10].

    ## Submission

    To submit you work, follow the same process outlined in [Reading 00]:

        :::bash
        $ git switch master                   # Make sure we are in master branch
        $ git pull --rebase                   # Make sure we are up-to-date with GitHub

        $ git switch -b reading05             # Create reading05 branch and check it out

        $ cd reading05                        # Go into reading05 folder
        $ $EDITOR answers.json                # Edit your answers.json file

        $ ../.scripts/check.py                # Check reading05 quiz
        Checking reading05 quiz ...
              Q1  4.00 /  4.00
              Q2  2.00 /  2.00
