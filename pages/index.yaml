    **CSE 30872** is an elective course in the [Computer Science and
    Engineering] program at the [University of Notre Dame].  This course
    encourages the development of practical programming and problem solving
    skills through extensive practice and guided learning. The bulk of the
    class revolves around solving *brain-teaser* and *puzzle-type* problems
    that often appear in programming contests, online challenges, and job
    interviews.  Additionally, basic software engineering practices such as
    planning, debugging, testing, and source code management may be discussed.

      Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

      1. **Parse** a variety of inputs and model problems.

      2. **Utilize** appropriate data structures to represent and solve problems.

      3. **Implement** common problem solving techniques and algorithms.

      4. **Employ** modern software development methods and tools.

      5. **Debug** and **test** code within an automated testing environment.

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "scale-balance" | embed_icon }}</i> Assignments and Assessments

    Students are expected to do all the **Reading** and **Challenge**
    assignments in this course, as they are **learning opportunities** that
    will prepare them for the coding **Contests** and **Interviews**.

    For each of the **two Units** in this course:

    - Only the `5` **Reading** assignments with the highest scores from the
      **Unit** will be counted towards the final grade.

    - Only the `10` **Challenge** assignment with the highest scores from the
      **Unit** will be counted towards the final grade.

    - Only the **Internal Contest** with the highest score from the **Unit**
      will be counted towards the final grade.

    - Only `1` **External Contest** will be required for that **Unit**.

    - A coding **Interview** will be conducted during the last week of the
      **Unit** to assess your learning and development.

    </div>

    <div class="alert info-bg" markdown="1">

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "calendar-check" | embed_icon }}</i> Due Dates

    All **Reading** and **Homework** assignments are to be submitted to your
    own private [GitHub] repository. Unless specified otherwise:

    - **Reading** assignments are due by **noon** on the **Monday** of the
      assigned week.

    - **Challenges** assignments are due by **noon** on the **Saturday** of the
      assigned week.

    - **External Contests** are due by **noon** on the **last day** of each
      **Unit**.

    ### Participation

    Students are expected to **attend** lecture and **participate** regularly
    during class by answering questions, contributing to discussions, and
    helping other students.

    Foreseeable absences should be discussed with the instructor ahead of time.

    ### Community

    Recalling one of the tenets of the [Hacker Ethic]:

    > Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not criteria such as degrees,
    age, race, sex, or position.

    Students are expected to be **respectful** to their fellow classmates and
    the course staff.

    ### Students with Disabilities

    Any student who has a documented disability and is registered with [Sara
    Bea Accessibility Services] should speak with the professor as soon as
    possible regarding accommodations. Students who are not registered should
    contact the [Center for Student Support and Care].

    ### Late Work

    In the case of a serious illness or other excused absence, as defined by
    university policies, coursework will be accepted late by the same number of
    days as the excused absence.

    Otherwise, there is an automatic penalty of `25%` **late penalty** for
    assignments turned in `12` hours pass the specified deadline.

    No assignments will be accepted after the **last day of class** without the
    permission of the instructor.

    ### Classroom Recording

    Lectures in this course will be recorded using **Zoom**, uploaded to
    **Panopto**, and shared on **Canvas** and the course website.

    Except for faculty and staff who require access, no content will be shared
    with individuals outside of the course without prior authorization.

    These recordings are jointly copyrighted by the [University of Notre Dame]
    and the instructor. Posting them to other websites (including YouTube,
    Facebook, SnapChat, etc.) or elsewhere without express, written permission
    may result in disciplinary action and possible civil prosecution.

    ### Academic Dishonesty

    Any academic misconduct in this course is considered a serious offense, and
    the strongest possible academic penalties will be pursued for such
    behavior.

    Students may discuss high-level ideas with other students, but at
    the time of implementation (i.e. programming), each person must do his/her
    own work. Use of the Internet as a reference is allowed but directly
    copying code or other information is cheating. It is cheating to copy, to
    allow another person to copy, all or part of an exam or a assignment, or to
    fake program output.

    It is also a violation of the [Undergraduate Academic Code of Honor] to
    observe and then fail to report academic dishonesty. You are responsible
    for the security and integrity of your own work.

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "alert" | embed_icon }}</i> CSE Guide to the Honor Code

    For the assignments in this class, students are allowed to consult printed
    and online resources and to discuss the class material with other students.
    Students may also consult **AI Tools** such as **CoPilot** or **ChatGPT**
    for help explaining concepts, debugging problems, or as a reference.
    Viewing or consulting solutions, such as those from other students,
    previous semesters, or generated by **AI Tools** is **never allowed**.

    Likewise, students may copy **small and trivial** snippets from books,
    online sources, and **AI Tools** as long as you **cite them properly**.
    However, students **may not copy** solutions or **significant** portions of
    code from other students or online sources, nor may students generate
    solutions via **AI Tools**.

    Finally, when preparing for interviews or exams in this class, **students
    may not access exams from previous semesters**, nor may students look at or
    copy solutions from other current or former students.  Furthermore,
    **students may not share the contents** of the interviews or exams with
    classmates who have not not yet taken the assessments.

      </tbody>
    </table>

    See the [CSE Guide to the Honor Code] for definitions of the above terms and
    specific examples of what is allowed and not allowed when consulting
    resources.

    If students are unclear about whether certain forms of consultation or
    common work are acceptable or what the standards for citation are, then
    students are responsible for consulting with the instructor to resolve any
    confusion.

    If the instructor sees behavior that is, in their judgement, academically
    dishonest, they are required to file either an [Honor Code Violation Report] or
    a formal report to the [College of Engineering] Honesty Committee.
