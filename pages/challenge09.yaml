    Tanner and Josh[^1] are in the **Logic Design** lab helping [Siddharth]
    debug some finicky **FPGAs**.  To track down one of the errors in their
    circuit, they have to analyze a series of **bitstreams** (ie. **32-bit
    integers**) and count how many times a particular **mask** appears in each
    **bitstream**.

    For instance, given a **mask** of `1001` (ie. `9` in **hexadecimal**) and a
    **bitstream** of `10010010` (ie. `146` in **decimal**), then the **mask**
    occurs `2` times in the sequence of bits.

    Likewise, given a **mask** of `1111` (ie. `F` in **hexadecimal**) and a
    **bitstream** of `1111111` (ie. `127` in **decimal**), then the **mask**
    occurs `4` times in the sequence of bits.

    Both of these examples are demonstrated below.

    Unfortunately, since Tanner and Josh are **CPEGs**, software is not really
    their strong suit[^2].  Therefore, they want you to help them write a
    program that analyzes **bitstreams** and counts the number of times a
    **mask** appears in the sequence of bits.

    ## Input

    You will be given a series of masks and bitstreams in the form of a
    **hexadecimal** `mask` and **integer** `bitstream`:

    ### Example Input

        :::text
        9 146
        F 127

    <div class="alert warning-bg" markdown="1">

    **Note**: Each **mask** is **4 bits**, while **integer** `bitstream` is a
      **32-bit integer**.

    </div>

    ## Output

    For each pair of `mask` and `bitstream`, computer the number of times the
    `mask` appears in the `bitstream` and then output a message in the following
    format:

    ### Example Output

        :::text
        1. 146 contains 0x9 2 times
        2. 127 contains 0xF 4 times

    For each input test case, your solution should have the following targets:

    <table class="bordered" markdown="1">
    <tbody markdown="1">
    <tr class="caution-bg" markdown="1">
      <td width="155px" markdown="1">**Time Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(N)`, where `N` is the number of bits in each input bitstream.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="warning-bg" markdown="1">
      <td markdown="1">**Space Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(1)`</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    Your solution may be below the targets, but it **should not exceed them**.

    </div>

    ## Submission

    To submit your work, follow the same procedure you used for [Reading 00]:

        :::bash
        $ cd path/to/cse-30872-sp26-assignments     # Go to assignments repository
        $ git switch master                         # Make sure we are on master
        $ git pull --rebase                         # Pull any changes from GitHub

        $ git switch -c challenge09                 # Create and checkout challenge09 branch

        $ $EDITOR challenge09/program.cpp           # Edit your code

        $ git add challenge09/program.cpp           # Stage your changes
        $ git commit -m "Challenge 09: Code"        # Commit your changes

        $ git push -u origin challenge09            # Send changes to GitHub

    To check your code, you can use the `.scripts/check.py` script or [curl]:

        :::bash
        $ .scripts/check.py
        Checking challenge09 program.cpp ...
        Result Success
          Time  1.97
        --------------------
         Score  6.00 /  6.00
         Grade  1.00 /  1.00

        $ curl -F source=@challenge09/program.cpp https://dredd.h4x0r.space/code/cse-30872-sp26/challenge09
        {"result": "Success", "score": 6, "time": 1.917165756225586, "value": 6, "status": 0}
