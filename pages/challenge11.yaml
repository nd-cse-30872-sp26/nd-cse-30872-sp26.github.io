title:      "Challenge 11: Sussy Dogecoin Transactions"

    Ever since his graduation, [AKK] has been devoting more and more time into
    investing in cryptocurrencies even while working at the [NSA].

    In particular, his favorite cryptocurrency is [Dogecoin]. Being the hacker
    he is, he was able to find an exploit to artificially create [Dogecoin] via
    clandestine **transactions**.  This discovery, along with his desire for
    [Fortnite Gift Cards], has naturally led him to the goal of taking
    advantage of this exploit to acquire unlimited V-Bucks.

    Unfortunately, the methods in which he can create his [Dogecoin] are
    **limited**, as he can only **double** or **add one** to his current
    amount, starting at `0`. In addition, he needs to **minimize** the number
    of transactions he performs so that his actions won't appear [sussy] and
    garner unwanted attention.  On top of this, in order to purchase the gift
    cards, he needs to exchange his Dogecoin to match the exact value of them.

    More specifically:

    > Given a value `N`, the worth (in [Dogecoin]) of a **Fortnite Gift Card**,
    find the **minimum number of transactions** needed to acquire `N` Dogecoin
    starting with none. Valid transactions include either **doubling** or
    **adding one** to the current amount.

    An example is shown below. Given a target value `N = 7`, the minimum number
    of transactions to acquire `7` Dogecoin when starting from `0` is `5` transactions.

    ## Input

    You will be given target values to attain, representing gift card values.

    ### Example Input

        :::text
        7
        8
        14
        23

    ## Output

    For each target value, output the minimum number of allowed transactions
    required to attain that value, as shown below.

    ### Example Output

        :::text
        1. Minimum number of doge transactions: 5
        2. Minimum number of doge transactions: 4
        3. Minimum number of doge transactions: 6
        4. Minimum number of doge transactions: 8

    For each input test case, your solution should have the following targets:

    <table class="bordered" markdown="1">
    <tbody markdown="1">
    <tr class="caution-bg" markdown="1">
      <td width="155px" markdown="1">**Time Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(N)`, where `N` is the target number of [Dogecoin].</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="danger-bg" markdown="1">
      <td markdown="1">**Space Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(N)`, where `N` is the target number of [Dogecoin].</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    Your solution may be below the targets, but it **should not exceed them**.

    ## Submission

    To submit your work, follow the same procedure you used for [Reading 00]:

        :::bash
        $ cd path/to/cse-30872-sp26-assignments     # Go to assignments repository
        $ git switch master                         # Make sure we are on master
        $ git pull --rebase                         # Pull any changes from GitHub

        $ git switch -c challenge11                 # Create and checkout challenge11 branch

        $ $EDITOR challenge11/program.cpp           # Edit your code

        $ git add challenge11/program.cpp           # Stage your changes
        $ git commit -m "Challenge 11: Code"        # Commit your changes

        $ git push -u origin challenge11            # Send changes to GitHub

    To check your code, you can use the `.scripts/check.py` script or [curl]:

        :::bash
        $ .scripts/check.py
        Checking challenge11 program.cpp ...
          Result Success
            Time  0.01

           Score  6.00 /  6.00
           Grade  1.00 /  1.00

        $ curl -F source=@challenge11/program.cpp https://dredd.h4x0r.space/code/cse-30872-sp26/challenge11
        {"result": "Success", "score": 6, "time": 0.016405344009399414, "value": 6, "status": 0}
