title:      "Reading 01: Sequence Containers"
body:       |

    **Everyone**:

    Next week, we will work on problems related to [sequence containers] such
    as [arrays], [lists], [stacks], and [queues].  While these are rather basic
    data structures, it is important to understand their properties and
    behavior, which we will take advantage of in [Challenge 01] and [Challenge
    02].

    ## Submission

    To submit you work, follow the same process outlined in [Reading 00]:

        :::bash
        $ git switch master                   # Make sure we are in master branch
        $ git pull --rebase                   # Make sure we are up-to-date with GitHub

        $ git switch -c reading01             # Create reading01 branch and check it out

        $ cd reading01                        # Go into reading01 folder
        $ $EDITOR answers.json                # Edit your answers.json file

        $ ../.scripts/check.py                # Check reading01 quiz
        Checking reading01 quiz ...
              Q1  6.00 /  6.00
              Q2  4.00 /  4.00
